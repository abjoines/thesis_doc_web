    <h3>PROTOTYPE 3</h3>
    <p>Digital Kinetic Sculpture: The Cornu Spiral</p>
    <p>In the previous prototypes, the generation of homeomorphisms hadnâ€™t been controlled. What I mean by this is that 
        there was no end result or surface in mind when deforming the sphere or the cube and that the sets of points were 
        randomly generated. For this prototype, I wanted to deform a surface with intention. The first step in this was 
        determining what I wanted the target surface to be. I chose the Euler Spiral, also known as the Cornu Spiral because 
        I figured a curve would be a good place to start with this kind of deformation. After experimenting with the different 
        methods of transformation in the last prototypes, I returned to Cinema 4D for this one. Below is a rendering of the 
        transition from sphere to Euler Spiral. </p>
