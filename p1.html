    <h3>PROTOTYPE 1</h3>
    <p>Animating the Transition Between Homeomorphic Surfaces</p>
    <p>After identifying the subject matter for my thesis, the first prototype was dedicated to exploring pre-existing tools 
        that could be used in the creation of homeomorphic surfaces. Since the rules of homeomorphisms state that there can 
        be no cutting, puncturing, or gluing I decided to create a couple of animations to show the seamless transition from 
        one surface to another. Using Cinema 4D I deformed both a cube and a sphere with built-in deformers that allowed for 
        animation. The results of these experiments are below.</p>
