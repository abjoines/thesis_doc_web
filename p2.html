    <h3>PROTOTYPE 2</h3>
    <p>Generating Homeomorphic Sets</p>
    <p>For the second prototype, I decided to take a programmatic approach to the generation of homeomorphisms. I chose to 
        use sets of points for this prototype in order to explore this subject through a two-dimensional lens. that is not 
        to say that these points could not also move along the z-axis. To create this prototype I used p5.js, forming a 
        grid of homeomorphic sets in order to convey the many possible ways these points could be organized. To maintain 
        clarity, the central node of each set is anchored in the middle. I also wanted to use this prototype to experiment 
        with interaction. You can generate more sets below by clicking anywhere on this page.</p>
